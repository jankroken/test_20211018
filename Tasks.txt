This is a simple calculator, where you should be able to type in simple equations and see the result.

There is a number of subtasks. Solve one before moving on to the next

The tasks to be solved in order are as follows:

1. Implement the calculator to handle simple single calculations, like 1+1. A session should
   prompt for a new equation with "> ", then calculate and print the result, before prompting
   for the next. This goes on until the user types "exit".
   could look like this:

   > 1+1
   2
   > 3+4
   7
   > 3*4
   12
   > exit
   Goodbye

   It should support the 4 operators + - * /
   If you divide by zero (by e.g. typing in "4 / 0"), then it should write "Divide by zero"
   If the user types in invalid input, it should write "Invalid input: <input>". Example: if the
   user types in "4a+3", the application should write back "Invalid input: 4a+3"

2. add support for longer equations (e.g. "1+4*3+11") and parenthesis (e.g. "1+(4*3+2)*11").

3. add a command "history". If you type "history", all equations from the beginning of the session should
   be printed, together with their answers.
   Also add a command "clear", which will clear the history.
   An example session could look like this:

   > 1+2
   3
   > 1+(2*3)
   7
   > 7/0
   Divide by zero
   > 4a+11
   Invalid input: 4a+11
   > 1+3
   4
   > history
   1+2 -> 3
   1+(2*3) -> 7
   7/0 -> divide by zero
   4a+11 -> invalid input: 4a+11
   1+3 -> 4
   > 2+4
   6
   > clear
   History cleared
   > 2+5
   7
   > 3*3+2
   11
   > history
   2+5 -> 7
   3*3+2 -> 11
   > exit
   Goodbye

4. support storing history, by adding two commands:
   - "save <filename>"   : stores the current history to a file
   - "load <history>"    : loads the current history from a file

  An example session could look like

  > 1+4
  5
  > 2*4
  8
  > save hist1.txt
  History saved to hist1.txt
  > 9*3
  21
  > load hist1.txt
  History loaded from hist1.txt
  > history
  1+4 -> 5
  2*4 -> 8
  > exit
  Goodbye
